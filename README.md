# HomeShare

## Objective

### Booking System
- Users should be able to browse available homes and make bookings for specific dates.

### Responsive Design

## Note
- Those who are not aware of backend API development can use static JSON to fetch the dummy response.
- This assessment primarily focuses on the frontend development, while, bonus if you also develop the backend APIs needed using Node.js.
- We request you to host the assessment on some free hosting server rather than sharing the plain repo with us. We would love to see your work live!
- Deadline for this assessment is 2 days from the day you get it.
- If you are also developing backend for the above assignment, then the deadline is 4 days from the day you received it.
- Please submit your assessment link on LinkedIn itself.
- Feel free to add, improve, according to your design skills, UI/UX is important.
- You are not expected to add a payment gateway. So demo payment will work.

## Submission
- Please include the GitHub repo link and all the steps to run the site.
